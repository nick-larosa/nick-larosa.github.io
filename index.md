## Intro

<img src="YJPQTV87-7PJ6.jpg" width="50%">

Hey everyone, my name is Nick LaRosa and I’m currently a senior/incoming grad student majoring in electrical engineering. I'm also the former secretary and electronics team lead for Lehigh Aerospace and an electronics designer for Lehigh Formula SAE.

While I did need to take an additional social science for my major, I decided to take Data Storytelling (COMM 165) specifically because I believe that the skills to interpret and visualize data is critically important, especially in a lot of fields within electrical engineering. In my free time, when I’m not studying or working on personal projects, I enjoy hiking, road tripping, and designing and flying RC planes. Some things I don’t enjoy are procrastinating, coronavirus, and zucchini.

## Week 3

### COVID-19: A Story in Seclusion

Since the COVID-19 virus was first discovered in humans in 2019, hundreds of thousands of people have tragically died, and billions of people around the world, from students to professionals and retirees, have been forced to dramatically change their lifestyles to protect public health. This tour explores some of the wide-ranging impacts of the virus, and it illustrates what many are doing to adapt to the new conditions and overcome the pandemic.

## Week 4

This heat map illustrates the geographical distribution of tweets containing the #quarantine hashtag between July 16 - July 25, when COVID-19 cases were increasing throughout the southern and western US. Tweet hotspots can be seen in southern California as well as Texas and Florida, where COVID-19 spikes were most pronounced. One particularly interesting observation is that the hashtag is still very popular in the New York City area, where cases at one time were the highest in the country but have since subsided. This could indicate a concern about a second wave, or lingering effects from when the cases were much higher and quanatines were in place. Data was sourced from Twitter through [Shiny Apps](https://bbspring.shinyapps.io/App24/) by Nicholas LaRosa.

## Week 5

This bar and pie chart illustrate all airplane crashes recorded and investigated by the NTSB from 2010 to the start of 2020. Aircraft accidents are mostly flat over the time period, but we can observe a noticeable decrease of over 15% from 2012-2013. This may be caused by a change in the way that the data was recorded or classified at that time.

We can also see an overall gradual increase in accidents from 2013 all the way through the end of 2019. This may be an indicator of improved worldwide economic conditions and an increased demand for air travel, which resulted in more airplanes in the air and, proportionally, more accidents.

From the pie chart, we see that there is a nearly even split between fatal and non-fatal crashes over the time period, with a slight majority of fatal accidents. While aviation as a whole continues to grow safer (in terms of fewer number of accidents), the distribution of this chart may indicate that there is not an implication that air crashes themselves are becoming less fatal.

Data is sourced from the [NTSB Aviation Accident Database & Synopses](https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx) and compiled by Nicholas LaRosa.

These maps provide a visualization of NTSB investigated aircraft crashes. The first indicates the type of aircraft using the color and the severity and number of fatalities using the size of the point. The second indicates the federal classification of aviation activity using the color.

From the first map, we can see a concentration of air crashes around the population centers, such as the east and west coasts and isolated midwest metropolises. Careful analysis of the map also shows that there is a higher number of helicopter crashes in areas with off-shore oil rigs, such as the gulf coast of Louisiana. Finally, we can see that more of the crashes are non-fatal in the largely flat and agricultural Midwest, while crashes in mountainous Colorado or eastern Tennessee are often fatal.

The second map provides one very clear but not immediately intuitive insight; the vast majority of air crashes in the United States involve general aviation aircraft, even though the vast majority of flights are airline/commercial. We also see hotspots of crashes involving agricultural aviation (crop dusters, etc.) in the Mississippi valley and the northern Midwest, but not as much in the flatter lower Midwest such as Iowa and Nebraska. This may be due to the fact that agricultural aviation is not as dangerous in these areas; pilots can simply land in a field if something is wrong, which may not be possible in the more hilly northern states and river valleys
