## Intro

Hey everyone, my name is Nick LaRosa and I’m currently a senior/incoming grad student majoring in electrical engineering. I'm also the former secretary and electronics team lead for Lehigh Aerospace and an electronics designer for Lehigh Formula SAE.

While I did need to take an additional social science for my major, I decided to take Data Storytelling (COMM 165) specifically because I believe that the skills to interpret and visualize data is critically important, especially in a lot of fields within electrical engineering. In my free time, when I’m not studying or working on personal projects, I enjoy hiking, road tripping, and designing and flying RC planes. Some things I don’t enjoy are procrastinating, coronavirus, and zucchini.
